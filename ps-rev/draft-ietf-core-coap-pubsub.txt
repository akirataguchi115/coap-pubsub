                   draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub-latest

Abstract

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and related extensions
   are intended to support machine-to-machine communication in systems
   where one or more nodes are resource constrained, in particular for
   low power wireless sensor networks.  This document defines a publish-
   subscribe Broker for CoAP that extends the capabilities of CoAP for
   supporting nodes with long breaks in connectivity and/or up-time.

1.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] supports
   machine-to-machine communication across networks of constrained
   devices (e.g., 8-bit microcontrollers with limited RAM and ROM) and
   constrained networks [RFC7228].  CoAP uses a request/response model
   where clients make requests to servers in order to request actions on
   resources.  Depending on the situation the same device may act either
   as a server, a client, or both.

   One important class of constrained devices includes devices that are
   intended to run for years from a small battery, or by scavenging
   energy from their environment.  These devices have limited
   reachability because they spend most of their time in a sleeping
   state with no network connectivity.  Another important class of nodes
   are devices with limited reachability due to middle-boxes like
   Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls.

   For these nodes, the client/server-oriented architecture of REST can
   be challenging when interactions are not initiated by the devices
   themselves.  A publish/subscribe-oriented architecture where nodes
   are separated by a broker and data is exchanged via topics might fit
   these nodes better.

   This document applies the idea of a "Publish/Subscribe Broker" to
   Constrained RESTful Environments.  The broker enables store-and-
   forward data exchange between nodes, thereby facilitating the
   communication of nodes with limited reachability, providing simple
   many-to-many communication, and easing integration with other
   publish/subscribe systems.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification requires readers to be familiar with all the terms
   and concepts that are discussed in [RFC5988] and [RFC6690].  Readers
   should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed in
   [RFC7252] and [RFC9167].  The URI template format [RFC6570] is used
   to describe the REST API defined in this specification.

   This specification makes use of the following terminology:

   publish-subscribe (pub/sub):  A messaging paradigm where messages are
      published to a Broker and potential receivers can subscribe to the
      Broker to receive messages.  The publishers do not (need to) know
      where the message will be eventually sent: the publications and
      subscriptions are matched by a Broker and publications are
      delivered by the Broker to subscribed receivers.

   publish-subscribe broker:  A CoAP server capable of receiving
      messages (publications) from CoAP clients acting as publishers and
      forwarding them to CoAP clients acting as subscribers The Broker
      can also temporarily store publications to satisfy future
      subscriptions and pending notifications.

   CoAP client (publisher or subscriber):  CoAP clients can act as
      publishers or as subscribers.  Publishers send CoAP messages to
      the Broker on specific topics.  Subscribers have an ongoing
      observation relation (subscription) to a topic.  Neither
      publishers nor subscribers need to have any knowledge each other;
      they just have to share the topic they are publishing and
      subscribing to.

   topic:  An unique identifier for a particular item being published
      and/or subscribed to.  A Broker uses the topics to match
      subscriptions to publications.  A reference to a Topic on a Broker
      is a valid CoAP URI.  Topics have to be created and configured
      before any data can be published.  Clients may propose new topics
      to be created; however, it is up to the broker to choose if and
      how a topic is created.  The broker also decides the URI of each
      topic.  Topics are represented as a resource collection.  The
      creation, configuration, and discovery of topics at a broker is
      specified in Section 2.  Interactions about the topic data are in
      Section 2.7.

   topic configuration:  Every topic is composed of two URIs topic
      configuration and topic data.  The topic configuration resource is
      used by a client to create, configure, update and delete
      configuration topics (see {#topics}).

   topic data:  Every topic is composed of two URIs topic configuration
      and topic data.  The topic data resource is used by publishers and
      subscribers to publish (POST) and subscribe (GET with Observe) to
      data (see {#topics}).

1.3.  CoAP Publish-Subscribe Architecture

   Figure 1 shows a simple Publish/Subscribe architecture over CoAP.  In
   it, publishers submit their data over a RESTful interface a broker-
   managed resource (topic) and subscribers observe this resource using
   [RFC7641].  Resource state information is updated between the CoAP
   clients and the Broker via topics.  Topics are created by the broker
   but the initial configuration can be proposed by a client, normally a
   publisher.

   The broker is responsible for the store-and-forward of state update
   representations between CoAP clients.  Subscribers observing a
   resource will receive notifications, the delivery of which is done on
   a best-effort basis.

           CoAP                     CoAP                      CoAP
          clients                  server                   clients
        ___________              __________    observe   ____________
       |           |  publish   |          | .--------- |            |
       | publisher | ---------> |          | |--------> | subscriber |
       |___________|            |          | '--------> |____________|
             .                  |          |                   .
             .                  |  broker  |                   .
        ___________             |          |   observe   ____________
       |           |  publish   |          | .--------- |            |
       | publisher | ---------> |          | |--------> | subscriber |
       |___________|            |__________| '--------> |____________|

             Figure 1: Publish-subscribe architecture over CoAP

   This document describes two sets of interactions, interactions to
   configure topics and their lifecycle (see Section Section 2.5)and
   interactions about the topic data (see Section Section 2.7).

   Topic configuration interactions are discovery, create, read
   configuration, update configuration, delete configuration and handle
   the management of the topics.

   Topic data interactions are publish, subscribe, unsubscribe, read and
   are oriented on how data is transferred from a publisher to a
   subscriber.

2.  Pub-Sub Topics

   The configuration side of a "publish/subscribe broker" consists of a
   collection of topics.  These topics as well as the collection itself
   are exposed by a CoAP server as resources (see Figure 2).  Each topic
   has a topic configuration and a topic data resources.  Topic
   configuration is used by a client creating or administering the topic
   and topic data is used by the publishers and subscribers to the
   topic.

                        ___
                Topic  /   \
           Collection  \___/
                           \
                            \___________________________
                             \          \               \
                              \ ......   \ ......        \ ......
                             : \___  :  : \___  :       : \___  :
                      Topic  : /   \ :  : /   \ :       : /   \ :
              Configuration  : \___/ :  : \___/ :       : \___/ :
                             :  _|_  :  :  _|_  :  ...  :  _|_  :
                      Topic  : /   \ :  : /   \ :       : /   \ :

                              topic 1    topic 2         topic n

           Figure 2: Configuration and Data resources of a topic

2.1.  Collection Representation

   Each topic-configuration is represented as a link, where the link
   target is the URI of the topic-configuration resource.

   Each topic-data is represented as a link, where the link target is
   the URI of the topic-data resource.

   The list can be represented as a Link Format document [RFC6690].  The
   link to each topic-configuration resource specifies the link target
   attribute 'rt' (Resource Type), with value "core.pubsub.conf" defined
   in this document.

2.2.  Topic Creation and Configuration

   A CoAP client can create a new topic by submitting an initial
   configuration for the topic (see Section 2.4.3).  It can also read
   and update the configuration of existing topics and delete them when
   they are no longer needed (see Section 2.5).

   The configuration of a topic itself consists of a set of properties.
   These fall into one of two categories: configuration properties and
   status properties.

   Configuration properties can be set by a client and describe the
   desired configuration of a topic.  Status properties are read-only,
   managed by the server, and provide information about the actual
   status of a topic.

   When a client submits a configuration to create a new topic or update
   an existing topic, it can only submit configuration properties.  When
   a server returns the configuration of a topic, it returns both the
   configuration properties and the status properties of the topic.

2.2.1.  Configuration Properties

   The CBOR map includes the following configuration parameters, whose
   CBOR abbreviations are defined in Section 4 of this document.

   *  'topic_name', with value the topic name of the a topic group
      encoded as a CBOR text string.

   *  'topic_data_uri', with value the URI of the topic data resource
      for subscribing to a pubsub topic encoded as a CBOR text string.

2.2.2.  Status Properties

   The CBOR map includes the following status parameters, whose CBOR
   abbreviations are defined in Section 4 of this document.

   *  'rt' with value the resource type "core.pubsub.conf" associated
      with topic-configuration resources, encoded as a CBOR text string.

   *  'conf_filter', is a CBOR map containing a CBOR array and with CBOR
      abbreviation defined in Section 4.  It is used when with FETCH
      when retrieving a partial representation of a topic configuration
      (see Section 2.5.2).

   *  'as_uri', with value the URI of the Authorization Server
      associated with the Group Manager for the topic, encoded as a CBOR
      text string.  Candidate clients that can configure topics will
      have to obtain an Access Token from that Authorization Server,
      before starting the topic configuration or creation.

   *  'kdc' TBD link to key distribution center

   *  'ace-pubsub-profile'?? TBD

2.2.3.  Topic Configuration Representation

   A topic configuration is represented as a CBOR map containing the
   configuration properties and status properties of the topic as top-
   level elements.

   Unless specified otherwise, these are defined in this document and
   their CBOR abbreviations are defined in Section 4.

2.2.3.1.  Default Values

   TBD

2.3.  Topic Discovery

   A Broker can offer a topic discovery entry point to enable clients to
   find topics of interest on the basis of configuration properties and
   status properties.

   Topics can be discovered by a client on the basis of configuration
   properties and status properties.  For example, a client could fetch
   a list of all topics that have a property of type "foo" or that have
   a property of type "bar" with the value 42.  Alternatively, topics
   can also be discovered simply by getting the full list of all topics.

   For broker discovery please see Section 2.6.3.

2.3.1.  Topic List Representation

   A list of group configurations is represented as a document
   containing the corresponding group-configuration resources in the
   list.  Each group-configuration is represented as a link, where the
   link target is the URI of the group-configuration resource.

   The list can be represented as a Link Format document [RFC6690] or a
   CoRAL document [I-D.ietf-core-coral].

2.4.  Topic Collection Interactions

   These are the interactions that can happen at the topic collection
   level.

2.4.1.  Retrieving all topics

   A client can request a collection of the topics present in the broker
   by making a GET request to the collection URI.

   On success, the server returns a 2.05 (Content) response with a
   representation of the list of all topics (see Section Section 2.2.3)
   in the collection.

   Example:

   => 0.01 GET
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: topics

   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: 40 (application/link-format)
      <coap://base-url/pubsub/topics/1>rt="core.pubsub",
      <coap://base-url/pubsub/topics/2>rt="core.pubsub",
      <coap://base-url/pubsub/topics/3>rt="core.pubsub"

2.4.2.  Getting Topics by Properties

   A client can filter a collection of topics by submitting the
   representation of a topic filter (see Section Section 2.5.2) in a
   FETCH request to the topic collection URI.

   On success, the server returns a 2.05 (Content) response with a
   representation of a list of topics in the collection (see
   Section Section 2.3.1) that match the filter.

   Example:

   => 0.05 FETCH
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: topics
      Content-Format: TBD (application/pubsub+cbor)

      {
          "prop1" : x,
          "prop2" : y,
          "prop3" : z
      }

   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: 40 (application/link-format)
      <coap://base-url/pubsub/topics/1>rt="core.pubsub",
      <coap://base-url/pubsub/topics/2>rt="core.pubsub",
      <coap://base-url/pubsub/topics/3>rt="core.pubsub"

2.4.3.  Creating a Topic

   A client can add a new topic to a collection of topics by submitting
   a representation of the initial topic configuration (see
   Section Section 2.2.3) in a POST request to the topic collection URI.

   The topic specification sent in the payload should use a supported
   serialization of the CoRE link format [RFC6690] but other
   serializations like [I-D.ietf-core-coral] may be used in the future.

   On success, the server returns a 2.01 (Created) response indicating
   the topic URI of the new topic.

   If a topic manager (TBD) is present in the broker, the topic creation
   may require manager approval subject to certain conditions (TBD).  If
   the conditions are not fulfilled, the manager MUST respond with a
   4.03 (Forbidden) error.  The response MUST have Content-Format set to
   "application/core-pubsub+cbor".

   The broker MUST respond with a 4.00 (Bad Request) error in the
   following scenarios:

   *  If any received parameter is specified multiple times, invalid or
      not recognized (malformed).

   *  If the Authorization Server with URI specified in the 'as_uri'
      parameter is not trusted and there is no alternative AS.

   => 0.02 POST
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: topics
      Content-Format: TBD2 (application/core-pubsub+cbor)

      {
        "topic_name" : sensor23,
        "as_uri" : "coap://as.example.com/token"
      }

   <= 2.01 Created
      Location-Path: pubsub
      Location-Path: sensor23
      Content-Format: TBD2 (application/core-pubsub+cbor)

      {
        "group_name" : "sensor23",
        "topic_data_uri" : "coap://pubsub-broker-uri/topics/sensor23/"
        "as_uri" : "coap://as.example.com/token"
      }

2.5.  Topic Configuration Interactions

   These are the interactions that can happen at the topic configuration
   level.

2.5.1.  Getting a topic configuration

   A client can read the configuration of a topic by making a GET
   request to the topic configuration URI.

   On success, the server returns a 2.05 (Content) response with a
   representation of the topic configuration.  The response has as
   payload the representation of the topic configuration as specified in
   Section 2.2.3.

   If a topic manager (TBD) is present in the broker, retrieving topic
   information may require manager approval subject to certain
   conditions (TBD).  If the conditions are not fulfilled, the manager
   MUST respond with a 4.03 (Forbidden) error.  The response MUST have
   Content-Format set to "application/core-pubsub+cbor".

   The response payload is a CBOR map, whose possible entries are
   specified in Section 2.2.3 and use the same abbreviations defined in
   Section 4.

   Example:

   => 0.01 GET
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: topics
      Uri-Path: 1234

   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: TBD2 (application/core-pubsub+cbor)

      {
        "group_name" : "1234",
        "group_title" : "Topic 1234 on broker xyz",
        foo
        bar

      }

2.5.2.  Getting part of a topic configuration by filter

   A client can read the configuration of a topic by making a FETCH
   request to the topic configuration URI with a filter for specific
   parameters.  This is done in order to retrieve part of the current
   topic configuration.

   The request contains a CBOR map with a configuration filter or
   'conf_filter', a CBOR array and with CBOR abbreviation defined in
   Section 4.  Each element of the array specifies one requested
   configuration parameter or status parameter of the current group
   configuration (see Section 2.2.3).

   On success, the server returns a 2.05 (Content) response with a
   representation of the topic configuration.  The response has as
   payload the partial representation of the topic configuration as
   specified in Section 2.2.3.

   If a topic manager (TBD) is present in the broker, retrieving topic
   information may require manager approval subject to certain
   conditions (TBD).  If the conditions are not fulfilled, the manager
   MUST respond with a 4.03 (Forbidden) error.

   The response payload is a CBOR map, whose possible entries are
   specified in Section 2.2.3 and use the same abbreviations defined in
   Section 4.

   Both request and response MUST have Content-Format set to
   "application/core-pubsub+cbor".

   Example:

   => 0.05 FETCH
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: topics
      Uri-Path: 1234
      Content-Format: TBD2 (application/core-pubsub+cbor)

      {
        "conf_filter" : [foo,
                         bar",]
      }

   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: TBD2 (application/core-pubsub+cbor)

      {
        "foo" : 10,
        "bar" : 5
      }

2.5.3.  Updating the Topic Configuration

   A client can update the configuration of a topic by submitting the
   representation of the updated topic configuration (see Section 3.1.3)
   in a PUT or POST request to the topic URI.  Any existing properties
   in the configuration are overwritten by this update.

   On success, the server returns a 2.04 (Updated) response.

   Example:

      }

2.5.4.  Deleting a Topic Configuration

   A client can delete a topic by making a CoAP DELETE request on the
   topic configuration URI.

   On success, the server returns a 2.02 (Deleted) response.

   When a topic configuration is deleted, the broker SHOULD also delete
   the topic data resource, unsubscribe all subscribers by removing them
   from the list of observers and returning a final 4.04 (Not Found)
   response as per [RFC7641] Section 3.2.

   Example:

   => 0.04 DELETE
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: topics
      Uri-Path: 1234

   <= 2.02 Deleted

2.6.  Publish/Subscribe

   Unless a topic is configured to use a different mechanism, publish/
   subscribe is performed as follows: A publisher publishes to a topic
   by submitting the data in a PUT request to a broker-managed "topic
   data resource".  This causes a change to the state of that resources.
   Any subscriber observing the resource [RFC7641] at that time receives
   a notification about the change to the resource state.  Observations
   are maintained and terminated as specified on[RFC7641].

   As shown in section Section 2, each topic contains two resources:
   topic configuration and topic data.  In that section we explained the
   creation and configuration of the topic configuration resources.
   This section will explain the management of topic data resources.

   A topic data resource does not exist until some initial data has been
   published to it.  Before initial data has been published, the topic
   data resource yields a 4.04 (Not Found) response.  If such a "half
   created" topic is undesired, the creator of the topic can simply
   immediately publish some initial placeholder data to make the topic
   "fully created".

   All URIs for configuration and data resources are broker-generated.
   There does not need to be any URI pattern dependence between the URI
   where the data exists and the URI of the topic configuration.  Topic
   configuration and data resources might even be hosted on different
   servers.

2.6.1.  Topic Lifecycle

   When a topic is newly created, it is first placed by the server into
   the HALF CREATED state (see Figure 3).  In this state, a client can
   read and update the configuration of the topic and delete the topic.
   A publisher can publish to the topic data resource.  However, a
   subscriber cannot yet observe the topic data resource nor read the
   latest data.

                      HALF                       FULLY
                    CREATED                     CREATED
                      ___                         ___     Publish
      ------------>  |   |  ------------------>  |   |  ------------.
          Create     |___|        Publish        |___|  <-----------'
                           \                   /         Subscribe
                      | ^   \       ___       /   | ^
                Read/ | |    '-->  |   |  <--'    | | Read/
               Update | |  Delete  |___|  Delete  | | Update
                      '-'                         '-'
                                  DELETED

                       Figure 3: Lifecycle of a Topic

   After a publisher publishes to the topic for the first time, the
   topic is placed into the FULLY CREATED state.  In this state, a
   client can read and update the configuration of the topic and delete
   the topic; a publisher can publish to the topic data resource; and a
   subscriber can observe the topic data resource.

   When a client deletes a topic, the topic is placed into the DELETED
   state and shortly after removed from the server.  In this state, all
   subscribers are removed from the list of observers of the topic data
   resource and no further interactions with the topic are possible.

2.6.2.  Rate Limiting

   The server hosting a data resource may have to handle a potentially
   very large number of publishers and subscribers at the same time.
   This means the server can easily become overwhelmed if it receives
   too many publications in a short period of time.

   In this situation, if a client is sending publications too fast, the
   server SHOULD return a 4.29 (Too Many Requests) response [RFC8516].
   As described in [RFC8516], the Max-Age option [RFC7252] in this
   response indicates the number of seconds after which the client may
   retry.  The Broker MAY stop publishing messages from the client for
   the indicated time.

   When a client receives a 4.29 (Too Many Requests) response, it MUST
   NOT send any new publication requests to the same topic data resource
   before the time indicated by the Max-Age option has passed.

2.6.3.  Broker Discovery

   Clients MAY discover brokers by using CoAP Simple Discovery or
   through a Resource Directory (RD) [RFC9167].  Brokers MAY register
   with a RD by following the steps on Section 5 of [RFC9167] with the
   link relation rt=core.ps.

   Brokers SHOULD expose a link to the entry point of the pubsub API at
   their .well-known/core location [RFC6690].

   Example:

   => GET
      Uri-Path: ./well-known/core
      Resource-Type: core.ps


   <= 2.05 Content
       </ps/>;rt=core.ps;ct=40

   For details topic discovery please see Section 2.3.

2.7.  Topic Data Interactions

   TBD

2.7.1.  Publish

   A topic must have been created in order to publish data to it (See
   Section Section 2.4.3) and be in the fully created state in order to
   the publish operation to work.

   A client can publish data to a topic by submitting the data in a PUT
   request to the topic data URI.  The topic data URI is indicated by
   the status property of type http://coreapps.org/pubsub#data
   (http://coreapps.org/pubsub#data) in the topic configuration.  Please
   note that the topic data URI is not the same as the topic URI.

   The data MUST be in the content format specified by the configuration
   property http://coreapps.org/pubsub#accept (http://coreapps.org/
   pubsub#accept) in the topic configuration.  Brokers MUST reject
   publish operations which do not use the specified content format.

   On success, the server returns a 2.04 (Updated) response.  However,
   when data is published to the topic for the first time, the server
   may instead return a 2.01 (Created) response.

   If the request does not have an acceptable content format, the server
   returns a 4.15 (Unsupported Content Format) response.

   If the client is sending publications too fast, the server returns a
   4.29 (Too Many Requests) response [RFC8516].

   Example:

   => 0.03 PUT
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: data
      Uri-Path: 6578616d706c65
      Content-Format: 112

      [...SenML data...]

   <= 2.01 Created


   => 0.03 PUT
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: data
      Uri-Path: 6578616d706c65
      Content-Format: 112

      [...updated SenML data...]

   <= 2.04 Updated

2.7.2.  Subscribe

   A client can get the latest published data and subscribe to newly
   published data by observing the topic data URI with a GET request
   that includes the Observe option set to 0 [RFC7641].

   On success, the broker MUST return 2.05 (Content) notifications with
   the data.

   If the topic is not yet in the fully created state (see
   Section 2.6.1) the broker SHOULD return a response code 4.04 (Not
   Found).

   The following response codes are defined for the Subscribe operation:

   Success:  2.05 "Content".  Successful subscribe, current value
      included Failure:

      4.04 "Not Found".  Topic does not exist.

   Example:

   => 0.01 GET
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: data
      Uri-Path: 6578616d706c65
      Observe: 0

   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: 112
      Observe: 10001
      Max-Age: 15

      [...SenML data...]

   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: 112
      Observe: 10002
      Max-Age: 15

      [...SenML data...]

   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: 112
      Observe: 10003
      Max-Age: 15

      [...SenML data...]

2.7.3.  Unsubscribe

   A client can unsubscribe simply by cancelling the observation as
   described in Section 3.6 of [RFC7641].  The client MUST either use
   CoAP GET with the Observe Option set to 1 or send a CoAP Reset
   message in response to a notification.

2.7.4.  Read Latest Data

   A client can get the latest published topic data by making a GET
   request to the topic data URI in the broker.

   On success, the server MUST return 2.05 (Content) response with the
   data.

   If the target URI does not match an existing resource or the topic is
   not in the fully created state (see Section 2.6.1), the broker SHOULD
   return a response code 4.04 (Not Found).

   If the Broker can not return the requested content format it MUST
   return a response code 4.15 (Unsupported Content Format).

   Example:

   => 0.01 GET
      Uri-Path: pubsub
      Uri-Path: data
      Uri-Path: 6578616d706c65


   <= 2.05 Content
      Content-Format: 112
      Max-Age: 15

      [...SenML data...]

4.  CoAP Pubsub Parameters

   This document defines parameters used in the messages exchanged
   between a client and the broker during the topic creation and
   configuration process (see Section 2.2.3).  The table below
   summarizes them and specifies the CBOR key to use instead of the full
   descriptive name.

   Note that the media type application/core-pubsub+cbor MUST be used
   when these parameters are transported in the respective message
   fields.

        +-----------------+----------+--------------+------------+
        | Name            | CBOR Key | CBOR Type    | Reference  |
        +-----------------+----------+--------------+------------+
